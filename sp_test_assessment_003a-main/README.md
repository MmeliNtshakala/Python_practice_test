Hello and Welcome to Bank City!

I'm an application brought to life by WeThinkCode_'s Student Performance Team. The inspiration for this application stems from the experiences of students embarking on the WTC_ course.

Consider the case of Eli, a student who, upon joining WTC_, faced the challenge of not having a bank account. As you may be aware, without a bank account, access to a monthly stipend becomes impossible.

In response to such scenarios, we've crafted this application to aid students who find themselves in similar situations. Rather than creating everything in isolation, we believe in the power of collaboration. We invite you to share your inspiration and input. Refer to the docstrings for guidance on each part of the application.

Let's build something great together!
